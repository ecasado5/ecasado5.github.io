## My CV

__•	Poject analysis:__
  
   ___o	Characterize the final user: who will be the final user? What is he/she expected to find in your project?___
  > I think the end user Will be a recruiter. She/he expect to know who am I, the places that I worked, what are my studies and if I am not stopped, in other words, if I   continue to learn complementari things about the technology aside my studies. Always improving.	

   ___o	Information architecture: in this project, which is assumed to be a singlepage project, this analysis isn’t very relevant___
   > It’s a One Page because the recruiter wants to know a basic information about you and wants a clear information, without much turn around.

   ___o	Visual design: which color palette will you use? Which typography? Which page layout? Look for inspirational similar projects___
   > This color palette is pastel, except for the green which is to give a little life to the palette, I have chosen these colors, because the curriculum should not hurt     the eyes, simply the colors should be friendly and that they have the same tune so as not to be too out of tune and make them not want to see your resume.
    And I like this colors!

   >The tipography that I used is the most simply letters that I found. I don’t have confucions about if I have a I or L and I think its very clear to read.

   >My page layout are a left side bar, a right part of content and a footer. This page is very simple, I don’t think it’s necessary put visual header, menus, etc.
